# Climate Wins Unsupervised Machine Learning
Using unsupervised machine learning models to pursue key climatological insights like regional resiliency and variance in extreme weather, general trends, and forecasting of future climate instability.  

Introduction and Background: In recent years weather event data has suggested that weather has grown more erratic and harder to predict across the globe, as well as the  severity of extreme weather. This could pose a serious risks to  human safety and infrastructure.  I
In response to these challenges, ClimateWins is  looking toward machine learning  models to pursue several key objectives.

Detect weather patterns in Europe that deviate from historical regional norms

Assess whether these atypical patterns are becoming more frequent

 Model potential future climate conditions over the next 20 to 50 years based on current trends

 Identify what he safest regions in Europe will be over the next 25 to 50 years



Data:
Historical climate data: Temperature (daily/monthly average highs/lows), precipitation, wind speeds, humidity, etc. over the past 50–100 years.
Extreme weather event logs: Frequency, intensity, and type (e.g., floods, droughts, heatwaves).
Temporal granularity: Data must be timestamped (daily/monthly/yearly) to capture seasonality and long-term trends.
Geospatial data: Latitude, longitude, elevation for each weather observation point.
Current and historical weather data: Temperature, precipitation,  humidity, drought frequency, etc. 

Necessary Data for Next Steps and Future Analysis: 
Infrastructure resilience:  Examples include availability and quality of roads, healthcare services and emergency services,  macro-architectural details, etc.
Socio-economic data: Population density, income levels, housing types, insurance coverage.
Environmental vulnerability indicators: Flood zones, wildfire risk, sea-level rise exposure.
Optional: Migration patterns, energy grid, agricultural trends, and topography info such as land use, elevation, proximity to coastlines or flood plains, etc.

Hypotheses:

If recent trends in temperature and precipitation continue, certain regions in Europe will experience significantly greater climate instability over the next 20–50 years. During this time, regions with higher infrastructure resilience, stable climate projections, and lower environmental exposure are more likely to remain safely habitable. Additionally, some regions experiencing increasingly frequent deviations from their historical weather norms are indicative of greater future instability.
